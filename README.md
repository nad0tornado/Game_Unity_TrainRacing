# Train Racing (Placeholder)

**A train-themed racing game based on the PS2 Game "XTreme Express" (2002). Compete in fast-paced races against other trains/players to reach the finish line first, or go head-to-head with another player or AI with various skill levels. Play special modes to unlock more trains, or set up a custom game with your own rules.**

### Stack: Unity3D, C# (.NET 4.7.1)

**Concepts Explored:** 
- Encapsulation & Abstraction
- Separation of Concerns & Single-Responsibility (SOLID)
- Interfaces
- Console-based Input (Xbox Controller)
- Bezier Curves (How the trains turn corners)

### Overview
I played the original "Xtreme Express" on Playstation 2 back in the early 2000s, and it was one of my favorite games. It was unfortunately never ported to PC, so this is my attempt at re-creating the same high-stakes, thrilling experience I had racing trains around as a kid.

I hope to release this game on Steam or another platform in the future for others to enjoy as well!

**Future Plans:**
- Drive a train from one end of the map to the other before time runs out, navigating tight bends and staying on the track
- AI Trains that you can race against
- A "Grand Prix" and "Tour" mode like the original game
- Multiple types of trains to unlock
- Multiplayer capability to vs other human players
